# Agent Work Summary & Next Steps

This document outlines the work completed by the AI agent during its sessions, details the final state of the project, and provides recommendations for future development.

## 1. Summary of Completed Work

Over several work cycles, the following major tasks were completed, transforming the project from its initial state to a more robust, feature-rich, and well-structured application:

### Architectural Refactoring
- **Unified AI Router**: A major refactoring was performed to replace disparate AI service calls with a single, sophisticated, rule-based `Router`. This new architecture (`Router.ts`, `RuleEngine.ts`, `PromptManager.ts`, `CacheManager.ts`) is now the central point for all AI interactions.
- **Headless `GraphicAI` Server**: The `GraphicAI` application was refactored into a backend-only MCP server. The entire frontend and its dependencies were removed, and the server now exposes its functionality via a standard MCP tool.
- **Code Cleanup & Simplification**: Redundant code, such as a parallel `ai-gateway` structure, was removed. The `Router` was refactored into a self-contained singleton to ensure consistent usage across the application. Obsolete deployment configurations for Railway and Azure were also removed.

### New Features & Tools
- **Standard Tools Completed**: Implemented the final two standard "Ashval World Building" tools: `ashval_character_dialogue_generator` and `ashval_auto_tag_system`.
- **Creative Tools Added**:
    - **Image Generation**: Integrated the `GraphicAI` service to provide advanced image generation capabilities.
    - **Mind Map Generation**: Created a new `ashval_mind_map_generator` tool that can analyze text or images and produce a mind map.
- **Testing Framework**: Established a testing foundation by adding and configuring the `vitest` testing framework. Wrote an initial unit test for the `RuleEngine` to prove the setup.

### Build & Type Safety
- **Build Resolution**: Solved a critical, persistent build environment issue that was blocking all testing and validation. This involved debugging numerous TypeScript errors related to dependencies, overly complex types (`TS7056`), and type mismatches with the Notion client (`TS2345`).
- **Improved Type Safety**: Refactored several Zod schemas to be more robust. Replaced `z.any()` and `as any` casts with type-safe solutions like `z.lazy()` and specific type assertions from the Notion client library, improving the overall quality and maintainability of the code.

### Documentation & Maintenance
- **Standardized Documentation**: Updated `README.md` and `docs/MCP-USAGE-GUIDE.md` to reflect the new architecture, configuration (`settings.json`, `config.json`), and features.
- **GitHub Actions Cleanup**: Simplified the CodeQL workflow and removed obsolete deployment workflows.
- **Added `codacy` tag**: Added the requested keyword to `package.json`.

## 2. Recommended Next Steps

The project is now in a stable, buildable, and well-architected state. The following steps are recommended to move it towards a production-ready release:

### High Priority
1.  **Complete AI Provider Implementations**: The `Router` is architected for multiple providers, but the implementations are currently mocks. The next step is to replace the mock logic with actual API calls using the respective SDKs for providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc. API keys should be read from `settings.json`.
2.  **Implement Real `GraphicAI` Service Call**: The `imageGenerationService` simulates the call to the `GraphicAI` MCP server. This should be replaced with a real network call to the running `GraphicAI` server's MCP endpoint.
3.  **Expand Test Coverage**: Now that `vitest` is set up, expand the test suite. Add unit tests for the `Router`, `PromptManager`, `CacheManager`, and all the MCP tools. Integration tests should be written to ensure the `Router` and tools work together correctly.

### Medium Priority
4.  **Enhance the `Router` with Real Multimodal Support**: The `mindMapGenerator` is designed to work with images, but the `Router`'s `handleQuery` method does not yet have a parameter for passing image data. This should be added to allow for true multimodal prompting.
5.  **Refactor to Dependency Injection**: As noted during the refactoring, the use of a singleton instance for the `Router` is functional but not ideal. A more robust solution would be to implement a dependency injection (DI) pattern, where services like the `Router` are provided to the classes and functions that need them. This would improve testability and maintainability.

### Low Priority
6.  **Enhance the Web UI**: The frontend could be updated to expose the new features, such as providing an interface for the mind map generator or allowing users to select their preferred AI provider from a dropdown in a settings panel.
7.  **Explore Advanced `GraphicAI` Features**: The `GraphicAI` service has options for different image `types` (sticker, icon, emoji). This could be exposed more directly to the user through the `imageGenerationService` and the UI.
